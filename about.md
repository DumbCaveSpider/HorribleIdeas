### Jokes
When pressing `Tab`, a menu will pop up with a list of joke mods you can enable on your game to do some interesting things to your gaming experience. From random mirror portals to game-breaking glitches! You can view more information within the contents of the menu itself.

#### Player Life
Give the player a limited health-like statistic that must always stay above 0 to prevent the player from dying.

#### Jumpscares
Typically give a chance to switch to a different level, mid-level. Boo.

#### Randoms
Minor but possibly devastating inconveniences that just pop in from time to time.

#### Chances
Trolls that happen on some sort of player interaction.

#### Obstructive
Disturb the player's accessibility to the gameplay.
